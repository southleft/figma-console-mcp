# Your Design System, Programmable

**"I can just do this in Figma myself."**

You're right. You can manually export design tokens. You can screenshot components and describe them to developers. You can copy-paste hex codes into Slack. You can document every button variant by hand.

But should you?

## The Real Problem

Design systems aren't static documents. They're living APIs that need to:

- **Stay synchronized** between design and code
- **Be queryable** by the tools developers already use
- **Generate code** in the formats your stack requires
- **Evolve** without breaking existing implementations

Every time a designer says "just check Figma," a developer opens a new tab, squints at a modal, eyeballs the padding, and writes `margin: 16px` instead of `var(--spacing-md)`.

Every time a design system update ships, someone somewhere hardcodes a color because "I'll fix it later."

## What If Your Design System Was an API?

Imagine asking your AI assistant:

> "Get the Button component specs and implement it in React with our design tokens."

And it just... works. Real component data. Real token values. Real code that uses your actual design system.

That's what Figma Console MCP enables.

## Two Paths, One Goal

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For Designers">
    ### Make Your Work Programmable

    Your design system is a product. Developers are your users. Give them an API.

    **What you'll do:**
    - Define tokens and components in Figma (what you already do)
    - Let AI extract and translate them into developer-ready formats
    - Keep a single source of truth that auto-syncs

    **What changes:**
    - Developers stop guessing at values
    - Design debt decreases because correct tokens are easier than wrong ones
    - Your documentation is always accurate (it's generated from the source)

    ### Consume Design Systems Like APIs

    Stop treating Figma as a screenshot machine. Query it.

    **What you'll get:**
    - Real token values in your preferred format (CSS, Tailwind, Sass)
    - Component specs with actual measurements, not approximations
    - Visual references alongside structured data

    **What changes:**
    - Implement components correctly the first time
    - Auto-generate design token files from source
    - Debug Figma plugins without Figma's dev tools

## Not Just Extraction—Creation

Most tools stop at reading. Figma Console MCP also writes.

In Local Mode, you can:
- Create variable collections with modes (Light/Dark/High Contrast)
- Generate component variants programmatically
- Organize component sets with professional labeling
- Modify existing designs through the Plugin API

```javascript
// Create a button with proper design system bindings
"Create a button component with 4 types, 3 sizes, 5 states.
Bind colors to my design system variables and
use spacing tokens for padding."
```

The AI understands your existing design system and creates new components that follow the same patterns.
