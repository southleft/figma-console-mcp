# Your Design System as an API

Design systems shouldn't be static documents locked in a visual tool. They should be **queryable**, **programmable**, and **always in sync** with your codebase.

Figma Console MCP bridges the gap between design and development—giving AI assistants complete access to your Figma files for extraction, creation, and debugging.

## The Problem

Every time a developer opens Figma, eyeballs the padding, and writes `margin: 16px` instead of `var(--spacing-md)`—that's design system debt.

Every design token manually transcribed to CSS, every component spec described in a Slack message, every "just check Figma" that leads to approximation—it compounds.

**What if your design system was queryable?**

```
"Get the Button component specs and implement it in React with our design tokens."
```

Real component data. Real token values. Real code that uses your actual design system.

## Two Workflows

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For Designers">
    ### Make Your Work Programmable

    Your design system is a product. Developers are your users. Give them an API.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Define in Figma">
        Create tokens and components as you normally would
      </Step>
      <Step title="AI Extracts">
        Design tokens export to CSS, Tailwind, or Sass automatically
      </Step>
      <Step title="Stay in Sync">
        Single source of truth that developers can query directly
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Result:** Developers stop guessing at values. Design debt decreases. Documentation stays accurate.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For Developers">
    ### Query Design Systems Directly

    Stop treating Figma as a screenshot machine.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Connect">
        Add the MCP server to your AI assistant
      </Step>
      <Step title="Query">
        Ask for token values, component specs, or visual references
      </Step>
      <Step title="Implement">
        Get code that uses your actual design system variables
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    **Result:** Implement components correctly the first time. Auto-generate token files. Debug plugins without Figma's dev tools.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
