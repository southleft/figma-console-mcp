# Figma Desktop API - The Real Solution

## Discovery

The **official Figma MCP** (`mcp__figma-official__get_variable_defs`) that comes with Figma Desktop DOES successfully retrieve variables WITHOUT Enterprise access!

### Test Result
```javascript
// Called: mcp__figma-official__get_variable_defs with nodeId: 1026:893
// Returns:
{
  "color/background/primary-default": "#4375FF",
  "color/background/default-stronger": "#3A3A3A",
  "theme/border/width/lg": "4",
  "text/primary": "#050a0f",
  "Heading/Medium/Semibold": "Font(family: \"Inter\", style: Semi Bold, size: 24, weight: 600, lineHeight: 32)",
  "color/content/default": "#F8F8F6",
  "theme/icon/md": "20",
  "spacing/050": "4",
  "spacing/100": "8",
  "Body/Large": "Font(family: \"Inter\", style: Regular, size: 16, weight: 400, lineHeight: 24)",
  // ... and more
}
```

## How It Works

The official Figma MCP connects through **Figma Desktop's local API**, not the REST API. This is why it can access variables without Enterprise access.

### Connection Method
1. Figma Desktop runs a local server/API
2. The MCP connects to this local endpoint
3. Has access to the full Plugin API including `figma.variables`
4. No Enterprise plan required!

## Implementation Strategy for figma-console-mcp

### Current Architecture (Not Working)
```
Browser → REST API → 403 Error (Enterprise Required)
         ↓
    Console Snippet → Manual Plugin Console → Capture Logs
```

### New Architecture (What We Should Build)
```
Figma Desktop Local API → Direct Variable Access
         ↓
    Automatic Extraction → Formatted Response
```

### Steps to Implement

1. **Find Figma Desktop's Local API Endpoint**
   - Likely running on localhost with a specific port
   - May use WebSocket or HTTP
   - Check Figma Desktop's developer tools

2. **Create Desktop Connection Service**
   ```typescript
   class FigmaDesktopService {
     private localEndpoint: string;

     async connectToDesktop() {
       // Connect to Figma Desktop's local API
     }

     async getVariables(fileKey: string) {
       // Use local API to get variables
       // Similar to how figma-official MCP does it
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Update figma_get_variables Tool**
   ```typescript
   // Add new method option
   if (args.method === 'desktop') {
     const desktop = new FigmaDesktopService();
     return await desktop.getVariables(fileKey);
   }
   ```

## Key Differences from REST API

| Aspect | REST API | Desktop API |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Access | Requires Enterprise | Available to all |
| Connection | HTTPS to api.figma.com | Local to Figma Desktop |
| Variables | `/variables/local` endpoint | `figma.variables` API |
| Authentication | API token | Local desktop session |

## Next Steps

1. **Research Figma Desktop's Local API**
   - Port number and protocol
   - Authentication method
   - Available endpoints

2. **Implement Desktop Connection**
   - Create service class
   - Handle connection lifecycle
   - Implement variable extraction

3. **Maintain Backwards Compatibility**
   - Keep console-based fallback
   - Add desktop as primary method
   - Graceful fallback if desktop not available

## Benefits

✅ **No Enterprise Required** - Works with any Figma account
✅ **Fully Automated** - No manual console steps
✅ **Complete Data** - Access to all variable properties
✅ **Real-time** - Direct connection to running Figma

## Conclusion

The solution has been in front of us all along - Figma Desktop provides a local API that the official MCP uses. We just need to connect to it the same way instead of trying to hack around the REST API limitations.
