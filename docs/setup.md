# Figma Console MCP - Setup Guide

Complete setup instructions for connecting Figma Console MCP to various AI clients including Claude Desktop, GitHub Copilot (VS Code), Cursor, Windsurf, and more.

---

## 🎯 Choose Your Setup

**First, decide what you want to do:**

| I want to... | Setup Method | Time |
|--------------|--------------|------|
| **Create, modify, and develop with AI** | [NPX Setup](#-npx-setup-recommended) (Recommended) | ~10 min |
| **Full capabilities with manual update control** | [Local Git Setup](#-local-git-setup-alternative) | ~15 min |
| **Just explore my design data** (read-only) | [Remote SSE](#-remote-sse-read-only-exploration) | ~2 min |

### ⚠️ Important: Capability Differences

| Capability | NPX / Local Git | Remote SSE |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Read design data | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Create components & frames** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Edit existing designs** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Manage design tokens/variables** | ✅ | ❌ |
| Screenshot validation | ✅ | ✅ |
| Desktop Bridge plugin | ✅ | ❌ |
| Variables without Enterprise | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Total tools available** | **56+** | **18** |

> **Bottom line:** Remote SSE is **read-only** with ~34% of the tools. If you want AI to create, modify, or develop from your Figma designs, use NPX Setup.

## 🚀 NPX Setup (Recommended)

**Best for:** Anyone who wants full AI-assisted design and development capabilities with automatic updates.

**What you get:** All 56+ tools including design creation, variable management, component instantiation, design-to-code workflows, and Desktop Bridge plugin support.

### Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, verify you have:

- [ ] **Node.js 18+** installed — Check with `node --version` ([Download](https://nodejs.org))
- [ ] **Figma Desktop** installed (not just the web app)
- [ ] **An MCP client** installed (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

### Step 1: Get Your Figma Token (~2 min)

1. Go to [Manage personal access tokens](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens) in Figma Help
2. Follow the steps to **create a new personal access token**
3. Enter description: `Figma Console MCP`
4. Click **"Generate token"**
5. **Copy the token immediately** — you won't see it again!

> 💡 Your token starts with `figd_` — if it doesn't, something went wrong.

### Step 2: Configure Your MCP Client (~3 min)

#### Claude Code (CLI)

**Option A: CLI command (quickest)**

```bash
claude mcp add figma-console -s user -e FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE -e ENABLE_MCP_APPS=true -- npx -y figma-console-mcp@latest
```

**Option B: Edit the config file**

If you prefer editing the JSON config file directly:

- **macOS / Linux:** `~/.claude.json`
- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\.claude.json`

Add the following to your `~/.claude.json` (create the file if it doesn't exist):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-console-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
        "ENABLE_MCP_APPS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> 💡 If `~/.claude.json` already exists with other MCP servers, just add the `"figma-console"` entry inside the existing `"mcpServers"` object.

#### Cursor / Windsurf / Other MCP Clients

Find your client's MCP config file and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-console-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
        "ENABLE_MCP_APPS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to **Settings** → **Developer** → **Edit Config** (or manually edit the config file)
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. Add the same JSON configuration shown above

4. **Save the file**

### Step 3: Connect to Figma Desktop (~2 min)

#### Install the Desktop Bridge Plugin

The Desktop Bridge Plugin connects via WebSocket — no special Figma launch flags needed, and it persists across Figma restarts.

1. **Open Figma Desktop** (normal launch, no special flags)
2. Go to **Plugins** → **Development** → **Import plugin from manifest...**
3. Navigate to the `figma-desktop-bridge/manifest.json` file in the figma-console-mcp directory
   - **NPX users:** Run `npx figma-console-mcp@latest --print-path` to find the directory
4. Click **"Open"** — the plugin appears in your Development plugins list
5. **Run the plugin** in your Figma file (Plugins → Development → Figma Desktop Bridge)
6. The plugin auto-connects via WebSocket (scans ports 9223–9232) — you'll see a "Connected" indicator

> **One-time setup.** Once imported, the plugin stays in your Development plugins list. Just run it whenever you want to use the MCP. No need to restart Figma with special flags.

**📖 [Desktop Bridge Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/southleft/figma-console-mcp/tree/main/figma-desktop-bridge)**

#### Multi-Instance / Port Conflicts

If you're running multiple MCP clients (e.g., Claude Desktop Chat + Code tabs, or Claude + Cursor simultaneously), the server automatically handles port conflicts:

1. **Update** to `figma-console-mcp@latest` and restart your MCP client(s)
2. **Re-import the Desktop Bridge plugin** in Figma (Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest). This is the critical step — the updated plugin scans ports 9223–9232 instead of only 9223
3. **Run the plugin** in your Figma file — it will find whichever port each server landed on

Step 2 is a one-time update. After re-importing, the plugin automatically connects to all active server instances across the full port range.

### Step 4: Restart Your MCP Client (~1 min)

1. **Restart your MCP client** (quit and reopen Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, etc.)
2. Verify the MCP server is connected (e.g., in Claude Desktop look for the 🔌 icon showing "figma-console: connected")

### Step 5: Test It! (~2 min)

Try these prompts to verify everything works:

```
Check Figma status
```
→ Should show connection status with active WebSocket transport

```
Search for button components
```
→ Should return component results from your open Figma file

```
Create a simple frame with a blue background
```
→ Should create a frame in your Figma file (this confirms write access!)

**🎉 You're all set!** You now have full AI-assisted design capabilities.

## 🔧 Local Git Setup (Alternative)

**Best for:** Users who want more control over when updates happen, or developers who want to contribute to the project.

**What you get:** Same 56+ tools as NPX. Updates are manual — you pull and rebuild when you're ready.

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] Git installed
- [ ] Figma Desktop installed
- [ ] An MCP client installed (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

### Step 1: Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/southleft/figma-console-mcp.git
cd figma-console-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for local mode
npm run build:local
```

### Step 2: Get Figma Token

Same as [NPX Step 1](#step-1-get-your-figma-token-2-min) above.

### Step 3: Configure Your MCP Client

#### Claude Code (CLI)

**Option A: CLI command (quickest)**

```bash
claude mcp add figma-console -s user -e FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE -e ENABLE_MCP_APPS=true -- node /absolute/path/to/figma-console-mcp/dist/local.js
```

**Option B: Edit the config file**

- **macOS / Linux:** `~/.claude.json`
- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\.claude.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/figma-console-mcp/dist/local.js"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
        "ENABLE_MCP_APPS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Other MCP Clients (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, etc.)

Edit your client's MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/figma-console-mcp/dist/local.js"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
        "ENABLE_MCP_APPS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:**
- Replace `/absolute/path/to/figma-console-mcp` with the actual path where you cloned the repo
- Use forward slashes `/` even on Windows

### Step 4: Connect to Figma Desktop

Same as [NPX Step 3](#step-3-connect-to-figma-desktop-2-min) above — install the Desktop Bridge Plugin.

### Step 5: Restart Your MCP Client and Test

Same as [NPX Steps 4 & 5](#step-4-restart-your-mcp-client-1-min) above.

### Updating

To get the latest changes:

```bash
cd figma-console-mcp
git pull
npm install
npm run build:local
```

Then restart Claude Desktop.

## 📡 Remote SSE (Read-Only Exploration)

**Best for:** Quickly evaluating the tool or read-only design data extraction.

**What you get:** 21 read-only tools for viewing design data, taking screenshots, reading console logs, and design-code parity checks.

> ⚠️ **Limitation:** Remote mode **cannot create or modify designs**. It's read-only. For design creation, use [NPX Setup](#-npx-setup-recommended).

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Claude Desktop installed
- That's it! No Node.js, no tokens, no Figma restart required.

### Method 1: UI-Based Setup (Claude Desktop)

1. Open Claude Desktop → **Settings** → **Connectors**
2. Click **"Add Custom Connector"**
3. Enter:
   - **Name:** `Figma Console (Read-Only)`
   - **URL:** `https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse`
4. Click **"Add"**
5. Done! ✅

OAuth authentication happens automatically when you first use design system tools.

### Method 2: JSON Config

Add to your Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

### What You Can Do (Read-Only)

✅ View design data and file structure
✅ Read design tokens/variables (Enterprise plan required)
✅ Take screenshots
✅ Read console logs
✅ Get component metadata

### What You Cannot Do

❌ Create frames, shapes, or components
❌ Edit existing designs
❌ Create or modify variables
❌ Instantiate components
❌ Use Desktop Bridge plugin

### Upgrading to Full Capabilities

Ready for design creation? Follow the [NPX Setup](#-npx-setup-recommended) guide above.

## 🤖 GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

GitHub Copilot supports MCP servers as of VS Code 1.102+.

### Prerequisites

- VS Code 1.102 or later
- GitHub Copilot extension installed and active
- For full capabilities: Node.js 18+ and Figma Personal Access Token

### Quick Setup (CLI)

**Full capabilities (recommended):**
```bash
# Create env file for your token
echo "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" > ~/.figma-console-mcp.env

# Add the server
code --add-mcp '{"name":"figma-console","command":"npx","args":["-y","figma-console-mcp@latest"],"envFile":"~/.figma-console-mcp.env"}'
```

**Read-only mode:**
```bash
code --add-mcp '{"name":"figma-console","type":"sse","url":"https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"}'
```

### Manual Configuration

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project:

**Full capabilities:**
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-console-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Security Tip:** Use `envFile` instead of inline `env` to keep tokens out of version control.

### Starting the Server

1. Open Command Palette (**Cmd+Shift+P** / **Ctrl+Shift+P**)
2. Run **"MCP: List Servers"**
3. Click on **"figma-console"** to start it
4. VS Code may prompt you to **trust the server** — click Allow

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Quick Fixes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| "Failed to connect to Figma Desktop" | No transport available | Install Desktop Bridge Plugin and run it in your Figma file |
| "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN not configured" | Missing or wrong token | Check token in config, must start with `figd_` |
| "Command not found: node" | Node.js not installed | Install Node.js 18+ from nodejs.org |
| Tools not appearing in MCP client | Config not loaded | Restart your MCP client completely |
| "Port 9223 already in use" | Another MCP instance running | As of v1.10.0, the server automatically falls back to ports 9224–9232. If the plugin can't connect, re-import the Desktop Bridge manifest. |
| WebSocket unreachable from Docker host | Server bound to localhost | Set `FIGMA_WS_HOST=0.0.0.0` and expose port with `-p 9223:9223` |
| Plugin shows "Disconnected" | MCP server not running | Start/restart your MCP client so the server starts |
| NPX using old version | Cached package | Use `figma-console-mcp@latest` explicitly |

### Node.js Version Issues

**Symptom:** Cryptic errors like "parseArgs not exported from 'node:util'"

**Fix:** You need Node.js 18 or higher.

```bash
# Check your version
node --version

# Should show v18.x.x or higher
```

If using **NVM** and having issues, try using the absolute path to Node:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "/Users/yourname/.nvm/versions/node/v20.10.0/bin/node",
      "args": ["-e", "require('figma-console-mcp')"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code OAuth Issues

> **⚠️ Known Issue:** Claude Code's native `--transport sse` has a bug where OAuth completes but the connection fails. Use `mcp-remote` instead.

**Don't use:**
```bash
# This has a known bug
claude mcp add figma-console --transport sse https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse
```

**Use instead:**
```bash
# This works correctly
claude mcp add figma-console -s user -- npx -y mcp-remote@latest https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse
```

Or better yet, use the NPX setup for full capabilities:
```bash
claude mcp add figma-console -s user -- npx -y figma-console-mcp@latest
```

### Config File Syntax Errors

If Claude Desktop doesn't see your MCP server:

1. **Validate your JSON:** Use a tool like [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com)
2. **Check for common mistakes:**
   - Missing commas between properties
   - Trailing commas (not allowed in JSON)
   - Wrong quote characters (must be `"` not `'` or smart quotes)
3. **Copy the exact config** from this guide — don't retype it

### Still Having Issues?

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/southleft/figma-console-mcp/issues)
2. Ask in [Discussions](https://github.com/southleft/figma-console-mcp/discussions)
3. Include:
   - Your setup method (NPX, Local Git, or Remote)
   - The exact error message
   - Output of `node --version`
   - Your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.)

---

## Optional: Enable MCP Apps

MCP Apps provide interactive UI experiences like the Token Browser and Design System Dashboard. As of v1.10.0, `ENABLE_MCP_APPS=true` is included in the default configuration examples above.

If you set up before v1.10.0, add `"ENABLE_MCP_APPS": "true"` to the `env` section of your MCP config.

> **Note:** MCP Apps require a client with [ext-apps protocol](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/misc/model_context_protocol/ext-apps) support.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Try example prompts:** See [Use Cases](use-cases) for workflow examples
2. **Explore all tools:** See [Tools Reference](tools) for the complete tool list
3. **Learn about the Desktop Bridge plugin:** See [Desktop Bridge README](https://github.com/southleft/figma-console-mcp/tree/main/figma-desktop-bridge) for advanced configuration
