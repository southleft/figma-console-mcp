> **Model Context Protocol server** that provides AI assistants with **real-time console access, visual debugging, design system auditing, and data extraction** for Figma files and plugins.

## Overview

Figma Console MCP is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that connects AI assistants (like Claude) to Figma for:

- **üêõ Plugin debugging** - Capture console logs, errors, and stack traces from Figma plugins
- **üì∏ Visual debugging** - Take screenshots of Figma UI for context
- **üé® Design system extraction** - Pull variables, components, styles, and file data
- **üîç Design system auditing** - AI-powered quality checks, token coverage analysis, compliance reporting
- **‚ö° Live monitoring** - Watch console logs in real-time as plugins execute
- **Zero-friction debugging** workflow (no copy-paste needed)
- **Dual deployment modes** - Local (for plugin development) or Cloud (for remote collaboration)

## Example Prompts

Once connected, try these prompts with your AI assistant:

### üêõ Plugin Debugging

**Cloud Mode (Default - No Setup Required):**
- "Navigate to my Figma plugin and show me any console errors"
- "Watch the console logs for 30 seconds while I test my plugin"
- "Get the last 20 console logs from https://figma.com/design/abc123"

**Local Mode (For Plugin Development - Requires One-Time Setup):**

> **üö® REQUIRED FIRST-TIME SETUP:**
>
> **Step 1:** Quit Figma Desktop completely (Cmd+Q / Alt+F4)
>
> **Step 2:** Relaunch Figma with remote debugging enabled:
> - **macOS:** Open Terminal and run:
>   ```bash
>   open -a "Figma" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222
>   ```
> - **Windows:** Open Command Prompt and run:
>   ```bash
>   start figma://--remote-debugging-port=9222
>   ```
>
> **Step 3:** Open your design file, run your plugin, then ask:
> - "Check the last 20 console logs"
> - "Show me recent error logs from my plugin"
> - "Watch for new console output"
>
> ‚úÖ **You only need to do this setup once per Figma session.** Your logs will appear instantly!
>
> See [LOCAL_MODE_SETUP.md](LOCAL_MODE_SETUP.md) for detailed local mode installation.

### üì∏ Visual Debugging
- "Take a screenshot of the current Figma canvas"
- "Navigate to this Figma file and capture what's on screen"
- "Show me what Figma looks like right now with a full-page screenshot"

### üé® Design System Extraction
- "Get all design variables from https://figma.com/design/abc123"
- "Extract color styles and show me the CSS exports"
- "Get the Button component data with a visual reference image"

### üîç Design System Auditing (NEW!)
- "Scan my design system file and give me a complete audit report"
- "Which components use hardcoded colors instead of design tokens?"
- "Show me variables that aren't being used anywhere"
- "Analyze my design system for naming consistency and compliance issues"

### üîÑ Combined Workflows
- "Navigate to my design system file and extract all variables"
- "Get the Tooltip component and help me implement it in React"
- "Check console errors while I test my plugin, then take a screenshot"

### ‚úÖ Quick Test
- "Navigate to https://www.figma.com and check the status"

## Figma Console MCP vs. Figma Official Dev Mode MCP

Both MCPs connect AI assistants to Figma, but serve different purposes:

**Figma Console MCP (This Project)** - Debugging, auditing & data extraction
- ‚úÖ Real-time console logs from Figma plugins
- ‚úÖ Screenshot capture and visual debugging
- ‚úÖ Error stack traces and runtime state
- ‚úÖ Raw design data extraction (JSON)
- ‚úÖ AI-powered design system auditing (like ESLint for Figma)
- ‚úÖ Token coverage analysis and compliance reporting
- ‚úÖ Works remotely via cloud or locally via Figma Desktop
- ‚úÖ Component images for visual reference

**Figma Official Dev Mode MCP** - Code generation from designs
- ‚úÖ Generates React/HTML code from Figma designs
- ‚úÖ Tailwind/CSS class generation
- ‚úÖ Component boilerplate scaffolding
- ‚úÖ Works remotely (Figma recently added remote access)
- ‚úÖ Component image export
- ‚ùå No console access or debugging features

### When to Use Each

Both MCPs can help with **component development**. Console MCP provides design specs as structured data, while Dev Mode MCP generates starter code.

**Use Figma Console MCP** when:
- Debugging Figma plugins (console logs, errors, runtime monitoring)
- Auditing design systems (token coverage, compliance, quality checks)
- Extracting design system data as JSON (variables, components, styles)
- You need visual debugging with screenshots
- Investigating runtime errors with stack traces
- Generating design system quality reports

**Use Figma Official MCP** when:
- Converting Figma designs into React/HTML code
- You want generated Tailwind classes and component boilerplate

**Use both together** for the complete workflow: generate code with Official MCP, then audit, debug and refine with Console MCP.

### Step 2: Add Your Figma Access Token (For Design System Tools)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Required for:** `figma_get_variables`, `figma_get_component`, `figma_get_styles`, `figma_get_file_data`, and other API-based tools.
>
> **Not required for:** Console monitoring, screenshots, and browser navigation.

**Get your token:** https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens

<details>
<summary><b>How to add your token to Claude Desktop</b></summary>

Edit your config file to include the `env` section:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_your_actual_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**After editing:**
1. Replace `figd_your_actual_token_here` with your actual token
2. Save the file
3. Quit Claude Desktop completely
4. Restart Claude Desktop

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How to add your token to other MCP clients</b></summary>

The same pattern applies - add an `env` object with `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_your_actual_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Advanced: Local Mode for Plugin Developers

If you're developing Figma plugins and need **zero-latency console log capture** directly from Figma Desktop:

### üö® Critical First Step: Enable Remote Debugging

**Before using local mode, you MUST restart Figma with the debug flag:**

1. **Quit Figma Desktop completely** (Cmd+Q on macOS / Alt+F4 on Windows)
2. **Relaunch with remote debugging:**
   - **macOS:** `open -a "Figma" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222`
   - **Windows:** `start figma://--remote-debugging-port=9222`
3. **Verify it worked:** Visit http://localhost:9222 in Chrome - you should see inspectable pages

**Then proceed to:** [LOCAL_MODE_SETUP.md](LOCAL_MODE_SETUP.md) for full local mode installation.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Quick fixes:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN not configured" | Add token to MCP config ([Step 2](#step-2-add-your-figma-access-token-for-design-system-tools)) |
| "Failed to connect to browser" | Wait 10-30s (cloud mode cold start) or check [LOCAL_MODE_SETUP.md](LOCAL_MODE_SETUP.md#troubleshooting) |
| Console tools work, design tools don't | You need to add FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN |
| Variables API 403 error | Enterprise plan required - MCP auto-falls back to Styles |
| Tools are slow | Normal for cloud mode first request (10-30s), then faster |
