> **Model Context Protocol server** that provides AI assistants with **real-time console access, visual debugging, and design system extraction** for Figma files and plugins.

## Overview

Figma Console MCP is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that connects AI assistants (like Claude) to Figma for:

- **üêõ Plugin debugging** - Capture console logs, errors, and stack traces from Figma plugins
- **üì∏ Visual debugging** - Take screenshots of Figma UI for context
- **üé® Design system extraction** - Pull variables, components, styles, and file data
- **‚ö° Live monitoring** - Watch console logs in real-time as plugins execute
- **Zero-friction debugging** workflow (no copy-paste needed)
- **Dual deployment modes** - Local (for plugin development) or Cloud (for remote collaboration)

## Example Prompts

Once connected, try these prompts with your AI assistant:

### üêõ Debugging & Console Monitoring
- "Navigate to my Figma plugin and show me any console errors"
- "Watch the console logs for 30 seconds while I test my plugin"
- "Get the last 20 console logs from https://figma.com/design/abc123"

### üì∏ Visual Debugging
- "Take a screenshot of the current Figma canvas"
- "Navigate to this Figma file and capture what's on screen"
- "Show me what Figma looks like right now with a full-page screenshot"

### üé® Design System Extraction
- "Get all design variables from https://figma.com/design/abc123"
- "Extract color styles and show me the CSS exports"
- "Get the Button component data with a visual reference image"

### üîÑ Combined Workflows
- "Navigate to my design system file and extract all variables"
- "Get the Tooltip component and help me implement it in React"
- "Check console errors while I test my plugin, then take a screenshot"

### ‚úÖ Quick Test
- "Navigate to https://www.figma.com and check the status"

## Figma Console MCP vs. Figma Official Dev Mode MCP

Both MCPs connect AI assistants to Figma, but serve different purposes:

**Figma Console MCP (This Project)** - Debugging & data extraction
- ‚úÖ Real-time console logs from Figma plugins
- ‚úÖ Screenshot capture and visual debugging
- ‚úÖ Error stack traces and runtime state
- ‚úÖ Raw design data extraction (JSON)
- ‚úÖ Works remotely via cloud or locally via Figma Desktop
- ‚úÖ Component images for visual reference

**Figma Official Dev Mode MCP** - Code generation from designs
- ‚úÖ Generates React/HTML code from Figma designs
- ‚úÖ Tailwind/CSS class generation
- ‚úÖ Component boilerplate scaffolding
- ‚úÖ Works remotely (Figma recently added remote access)
- ‚úÖ Component image export
- ‚ùå No console access or debugging features

### When to Use Each

Both MCPs can help with **component development**. Console MCP provides design specs as structured data, while Dev Mode MCP generates starter code.

**Use Figma Console MCP** when:
- Debugging Figma plugins (console logs, errors, runtime monitoring)
- Extracting design system data as JSON (variables, components, styles)
- You need visual debugging with screenshots
- Investigating runtime errors with stack traces

**Use Figma Official MCP** when:
- Converting Figma designs into React/HTML code
- You want generated Tailwind classes and component boilerplate

**Use both together** for the complete workflow: generate code with Official MCP, then debug and refine with Console MCP.

<summary><b>Claude Code (VS Code Extension)</b></summary>

**One-line install:**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse figma-console https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse
```

**Verify:**
- Use `/mcp` command in Claude Code
- Should show "figma-console: connected"

**See [CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md](docs/CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md) for troubleshooting.**

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b></summary>

**Location:** `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` globally

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

**After editing:**
1. Save and restart Cursor
2. Check for MCP connection indicator
3. Test with a prompt like "Navigate to https://www.figma.com"

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Zed</b></summary>

**Location:** `~/.config/zed/settings.json` (Linux/macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Zed\settings.json` (Windows)

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": {
        "path": "npx",
        "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Other MCP Clients</b></summary>

Use the same configuration pattern:

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"]
}
```

Consult your MCP client's documentation for the specific configuration file location.

</details>

### Step 2: Add Your Figma Access Token (For Design System Tools)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Required for:** `figma_get_variables`, `figma_get_component`, `figma_get_styles`, `figma_get_file_data`, and other API-based tools.
>
> **Not required for:** Console monitoring, screenshots, and browser navigation.

**Get your token:** https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens

<details>
<summary><b>How to add your token to Claude Desktop</b></summary>

Edit your config file to include the `env` section:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_your_actual_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**After editing:**
1. Replace `figd_your_actual_token_here` with your actual token
2. Save the file
3. Quit Claude Desktop completely
4. Restart Claude Desktop

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How to add your token to other MCP clients</b></summary>

The same pattern applies - add an `env` object with `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_your_actual_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Troubleshooting

### "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN not configured"

This error appears when using design system tools (`figma_get_variables`, `figma_get_component`, etc.) without setting your Figma access token.

**Solution:** Add your token to your MCP client config (see [Step 2](#step-2-add-your-figma-access-token-for-design-system-tools))

### "Failed to connect to browser"

**Cloud mode:** This is usually temporary. The Cloudflare Browser Rendering API may be initializing. Try again in a few seconds.

**Local mode:** See [LOCAL_MODE_SETUP.md](LOCAL_MODE_SETUP.md#troubleshooting)

### Console tools work but design tools don't

You have the MCP connected, but haven't added your `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

**Solution:** Add your token to the `env` section of your MCP config (see [Step 2](#step-2-add-your-figma-access-token-for-design-system-tools))

### Variables API returns 403 error

The Figma Variables API requires an Enterprise plan. The MCP will automatically fall back to Styles API or provide alternative extraction methods.

### Tools are slow in cloud mode

Cloud mode uses Cloudflare Browser Rendering API, which may have a cold start delay. After the first request, subsequent requests are typically faster.

For plugin development workflows that need instant feedback, consider [Local Mode](LOCAL_MODE_SETUP.md).
