---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Choose Your Setup

**First, decide what you want to do:**

| I want to... | Setup Method | Time |
|--------------|--------------|------|
| **Create and modify designs with AI** | [NPX Setup](#-npx-setup-recommended) (Recommended) | ~10 min |
| **Design from the web** (Claude.ai, v0, Replit, Lovable) | [Cloud Mode](#-cloud-mode-web-ai-clients) | ~5 min |
| **Contribute to the project** | [Local Git Setup](#for-contributors-local-git-mode) | ~15 min |
| **Just explore my design data** (read-only) | [Remote SSE](#-remote-sse-read-only-exploration) | ~2 min |

### ⚠️ Important: Capability Differences

| Capability | NPX / Local Git | Cloud Mode | Remote SSE |
|------------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| Read design data | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Create components & frames** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Edit existing designs** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Manage design tokens/variables** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Real-time monitoring (console, selection) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Desktop Bridge plugin | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Requires Node.js | Yes | **No** | No |
| **Total tools available** | **59+** | **43** | **22** |

> **Bottom line:** Remote SSE is **read-only** with ~38% of the tools. **Cloud Mode** unlocks write access from web AI clients without Node.js. NPX/Local Git gives the full 59+ tools with real-time monitoring.

---

### 🚀 NPX Setup (Recommended)

**Best for:** Designers who want full AI-assisted design capabilities.

**What you get:** All 59+ tools including design creation, variable management, and component instantiation.

#### Prerequisites

- [ ] **Node.js 18+** — Check with `node --version` ([Download](https://nodejs.org))
- [ ] **Figma Desktop** installed (not just the web app)
- [ ] **An MCP client** (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, etc.)

#### Step 1: Get Your Figma Token

1. Go to [Manage personal access tokens](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens) in Figma Help
2. Follow the steps to **create a new personal access token**
3. Enter description: `Figma Console MCP`
4. **Copy the token** — you won't see it again! (starts with `figd_`)

#### Step 2: Configure Your MCP Client

**Claude Code (CLI):**
```bash
claude mcp add figma-console -s user -e FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE -e ENABLE_MCP_APPS=true -- npx -y figma-console-mcp@latest
```

**Cursor / Windsurf / Claude Desktop:**

Add to your MCP config file (see [Where to find your config file](#-where-to-find-your-config-file) below):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-console-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
        "ENABLE_MCP_APPS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 📂 Where to Find Your Config File

If you're not sure where to put the JSON configuration above, here's where each app stores its MCP config:

| App | macOS | Windows |
|-----|-------|---------|
| **Claude Desktop** | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| **Claude Code (CLI)** | `~/.claude.json` | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude.json` |
| **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | `%USERPROFILE%\.cursor\mcp.json` |
| **Windsurf** | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` | `%USERPROFILE%\.codeium\windsurf\mcp_config.json` |

> **Tip for designers:** The `~` symbol means your **home folder**. On macOS, that's `/Users/YourName/`. On Windows, it's `C:\Users\YourName\`. You can open these files in any text editor — even TextEdit or Notepad.
>
> **Can't find the file?** If it doesn't exist yet, create it. The app will pick it up on its next restart. Make sure the entire file is valid JSON (watch for missing commas or brackets).
>
> **Claude Code users:** You can skip manual editing entirely. Just run the `claude mcp add` command above and it handles everything for you.

#### Step 3: Connect to Figma Desktop

**Desktop Bridge Plugin:**
1. Open Figma Desktop normally (no special flags needed)
2. Go to **Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest...**
3. Select `figma-desktop-bridge/manifest.json` from the figma-console-mcp directory
   - **NPX users:** Run `npx figma-console-mcp@latest --print-path` to find the directory
4. Run the plugin in your Figma file — it auto-connects via WebSocket (scans ports 9223–9232)

> One-time setup. The plugin persists in your Development plugins list across sessions.

#### Step 4: Restart Your MCP Client

Restart your MCP client to load the new configuration.

#### Step 5: Test It!

```
Check Figma status
```
→ Should show connection status with active WebSocket transport

```
Create a simple frame with a blue background
```
→ Should create a frame in Figma (confirms write access!)

### For Contributors: Local Git Mode

**Best for:** Developers who want to modify source code or contribute to the project.

**What you get:** Same 59+ tools as NPX, plus full source code access.

#### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/southleft/figma-console-mcp.git
cd figma-console-mcp
npm install
npm run build:local
```

#### Configure Your MCP Client

Add to your config file (see [Where to find your config file](#-where-to-find-your-config-file)):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/figma-console-mcp/dist/local.js"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
        "ENABLE_MCP_APPS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then follow [NPX Steps 3-5](#step-3-connect-to-figma-desktop) above.

**📖 [Complete Setup Guide](docs/setup.md)**

### 📡 Remote SSE (Read-Only Exploration)

**Best for:** Quickly evaluating the tool or read-only design data extraction.

**What you get:** 22 read-only tools — view data, take screenshots, read logs, design-code parity. **Cannot create or modify designs.**

#### Claude Desktop (UI Method)

1. Open Claude Desktop → **Settings** → **Connectors**
2. Click **"Add Custom Connector"**
3. Enter:
   - **Name:** `Figma Console (Read-Only)`
   - **URL:** `https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse`
4. Click **"Add"** — Done! ✅

OAuth authentication happens automatically when you first use design system tools.

#### Claude Code

> **⚠️ Known Issue:** Claude Code's native `--transport sse` has a [bug](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/2466). Use `mcp-remote` instead:

```bash
claude mcp add figma-console -s user -- npx -y mcp-remote@latest https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse
```

**💡 Tip:** For full capabilities, use [NPX Setup](#-npx-setup-recommended) instead of Remote SSE.

#### Other Clients (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Upgrading to Full Capabilities

Ready for design creation? Follow the [NPX Setup](#-npx-setup-recommended) guide above, or try [Cloud Mode](#-cloud-mode-web-ai-clients) if you don't want to install Node.js.

**📖 [Complete Setup Guide](docs/setup.md)**

---

### ☁️ Cloud Mode (Web AI Clients)

**Best for:** Using Claude.ai, v0, Replit, or Lovable to create and modify Figma designs — no Node.js required.

**What you get:** 43 tools including full write access — design creation, variable management, component instantiation, and all REST API tools. Only real-time monitoring (console logs, selection tracking, document changes) requires Local Mode.

#### Prerequisites

- [ ] **Figma Desktop** with the Desktop Bridge plugin installed (see [Desktop Bridge setup](#step-3-connect-to-figma-desktop))
- [ ] **A web AI client** connected to the remote MCP endpoint (see [Remote SSE setup](#-remote-sse-read-only-exploration))

#### How to Connect

1. **Set up Remote SSE** if you haven't already — follow the [Remote SSE](#-remote-sse-read-only-exploration) steps above
2. **Open the Desktop Bridge plugin** in Figma Desktop (Plugins → Development → Figma Desktop Bridge)
3. **Tell your AI assistant:**
   ```
   Connect to my Figma plugin
   ```
4. **The AI gives you a 6-character pairing code** (expires in 5 minutes)
5. **In the plugin:** Toggle "Cloud Mode" → enter the code → click Connect
6. **You're paired!** Full write access is now available

#### What You Can Do

Once paired, use natural language to design:
```
Create a card component with a header image, title, description, and action button
Set up a color token collection with Light and Dark modes
Add a "High Contrast" mode to my existing token collection
```

#### How It Works

Your AI client sends write commands through the cloud MCP server, which relays them via WebSocket to the Desktop Bridge plugin running in your Figma Desktop. The plugin executes the commands using the Figma Plugin API and returns results back through the same path.

```
AI Client → Cloud MCP Server → Durable Object Relay → Desktop Bridge Plugin → Figma
```

> **Variables on any plan:** Cloud Mode uses the Plugin API (not the Enterprise REST API), so variable management works on Free, Pro, and Organization plans.

## 🎨 AI-Assisted Design Creation

> **Requires Desktop Bridge:** This feature works with Local Mode (NPX or Local Git) and [Cloud Mode](#-cloud-mode-web-ai-clients). Remote SSE without Cloud Mode pairing is read-only and cannot create or modify designs.

One of the most powerful capabilities of this MCP server is the ability to **design complete UI components and pages directly in Figma through natural language conversation** with any MCP-compatible AI assistant like Claude Desktop or Claude Code.

### What's Possible

**Create original designs from scratch:**
```
Design a login card with email and password fields, a "Forgot password?" link,
and a primary Sign In button. Use 32px padding, 16px border radius, and subtle shadow.
```

**Leverage existing component libraries:**
```
Build a dashboard header using the Avatar component for the user profile,
Button components for actions, and Badge components for notifications.
```

**Generate complete page layouts:**
```
Create a settings page with a sidebar navigation, a main content area with form fields,
and a sticky footer with Save and Cancel buttons.
```

### How It Works

1. **You describe what you want** in plain English
2. **The AI searches your component library** using `figma_search_components` to find relevant building blocks
3. **Components are instantiated** with proper variants and properties via `figma_instantiate_component`
4. **Custom elements are created** using the full Figma Plugin API via `figma_execute`
5. **Visual validation** automatically captures screenshots and iterates until the design looks right

### Who Benefits

| Role | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **Designers** | Rapidly prototype ideas without manual frame-by-frame construction. Explore variations quickly by describing changes. |
| **Developers** | Generate UI mockups during planning discussions. Create visual specs without switching to design tools. |
| **Product Managers** | Sketch out feature concepts during ideation. Communicate visual requirements directly to stakeholders. |
| **Design System Teams** | Test component flexibility by generating compositions. Identify gaps in component coverage. |
| **Agencies** | Speed up initial concept delivery. Iterate on client feedback in real-time during calls. |

### Example Workflows

**Brand New Design:**
> "Create a notification toast with an icon on the left, title and description text, and a dismiss button. Use our brand colors."

The AI creates custom frames, applies your design tokens, and builds the component from scratch.

**Component Composition:**
> "Build a user profile card using the Avatar component (large size), two Button components (Edit Profile and Settings), and a Badge for the user's status."

The AI searches your library, finds the exact components, and assembles them with proper spacing and alignment.

**Design Iteration:**
> "The spacing feels too tight. Increase the gap between sections to 24px and make the heading larger."

The AI modifies the existing design, takes a screenshot to verify, and continues iterating until you're satisfied.

### Visual Validation

The AI automatically follows a validation workflow after creating designs:

1. **Create** → Execute the design code
2. **Screenshot** → Capture the result
3. **Analyze** → Check alignment, spacing, and visual balance
4. **Iterate** → Fix any issues detected
5. **Verify** → Final screenshot to confirm

This ensures designs aren't just technically correct—they *look* right.

## 🎨 Desktop Bridge Plugin (Recommended Connection)

The **Figma Desktop Bridge** plugin is the recommended way to connect Figma to the MCP server. It communicates via WebSocket — no special Figma launch flags needed, and it persists across Figma restarts.

### Setup

1. Open Figma Desktop (normal launch — no debug flags needed)
2. Go to **Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest...**
3. Select `figma-desktop-bridge/manifest.json` from the figma-console-mcp directory
4. Run the plugin in your Figma file — it auto-connects via WebSocket (scans ports 9223–9232)
5. Ask your AI: "Check Figma status" to verify the connection

> **One-time import.** Once imported, the plugin stays in your Development plugins list. Just run it whenever you want to use the MCP.

**📖 [Desktop Bridge Documentation](figma-desktop-bridge/README.md)**

### Capabilities

**Read Operations:**
- Variables without Enterprise API
- Reliable component descriptions (bypasses API bugs)
- Multi-mode support (Light/Dark/Brand variants)
- Real-time selection tracking and document change monitoring

**Write Operations:**
- **Design Creation** - Create frames, shapes, text, components via `figma_execute`
- **Variable Management** - Full CRUD operations on variables and collections
- **Mode Management** - Add and rename modes for multi-theme support

### How the Transport Works

- The MCP server communicates via **WebSocket** through the Desktop Bridge plugin
- The server tries port 9223 first, then automatically falls back through ports 9224–9232 if needed
- The plugin scans all ports in the range and connects to every active server it finds
- All 59+ tools work through the WebSocket transport

**Multiple files:** The WebSocket server supports multiple simultaneous plugin connections — one per open Figma file. Each connection is tracked by file key with independent state (selection, document changes, console logs).

**Environment variables:**
- `FIGMA_WS_PORT` — Override the preferred WebSocket port (default: 9223). The server will fall back through a 10-port range starting from this value if the preferred port is occupied.
- `FIGMA_WS_HOST` — Override the WebSocket server bind address (default: `localhost`). Set to `0.0.0.0` when running inside Docker so the host machine can reach the MCP server.

**Cloud Mode:** The plugin also supports a **Cloud Mode** toggle for pairing with web AI clients (Claude.ai, v0, Replit, Lovable). Toggle "Cloud Mode" in the plugin UI, enter the 6-character pairing code from your AI assistant, and click Connect. See [Cloud Mode](#-cloud-mode-web-ai-clients) for details.

**Plugin Limitation:** In Local Mode, works with NPX or Local Git. In Cloud Mode, pairs with the remote MCP endpoint. Remote SSE without Cloud Mode pairing is read-only.

---

## 🔀 Multi-Instance Support (v1.10.0)

Figma Console MCP now supports **multiple simultaneous instances** — perfect for designers and developers who work across multiple projects or use Claude Desktop's Chat and Code tabs at the same time.

### The Problem (Before v1.10.0)

When two processes tried to start the MCP server (e.g., Claude Desktop's Chat tab and Code tab), the second one would crash with `EADDRINUSE` because both competed for port 9223.

### How It Works Now

- The server tries port **9223** first (the default)
- If that port is already taken, it automatically tries **9224**, then **9225**, and so on up to **9232**
- The Desktop Bridge plugin in Figma connects to **all** active servers simultaneously
- Every server instance receives real-time events (selection changes, document changes, console logs)
- `figma_get_status` shows which port you're on and lists other active instances

### What This Means for You

| Scenario | Before v1.10.0 | Now |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Two Claude Desktop tabs (Chat + Code) | Second tab crashes | Both work independently |
| Multiple CLI terminals on different projects | Only one can run | All run simultaneously |
| Claude Desktop + Claude Code CLI | Port conflict | Both coexist |

### Do I Need to Do Anything?

**If you're running a single instance:** Nothing changes. You'll still use port 9223 as before.

**If you want multi-instance:** Re-import the Desktop Bridge plugin in Figma (Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest). This updates the plugin to scan all ports and connect to every active server.

> **Note:** The server-side update happens automatically when you update the npm package. Only the plugin needs a one-time re-import to enable multi-connection support.

## 🧩 MCP Apps (Experimental)

Figma Console MCP includes support for **MCP Apps** — rich interactive UI experiences that render directly inside any MCP client that supports the [MCP Apps protocol extension](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/misc/model_context_protocol/ext-apps). Built with the official [`@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps) SDK.

> **What are MCP Apps?** Traditional MCP tools return text or images to the AI. MCP Apps go further — they render interactive HTML interfaces inline in the chat, allowing users to browse, filter, and interact with data directly without consuming AI context.

### Token Browser

An interactive design token explorer.

**Usage:** Ask Claude to "browse the design tokens" or "show me the design tokens" while connected to a Figma file.

**Features:**
- Browse all tokens organized by collection with expandable sections
- Filter by type (Colors, Numbers, Strings) and search by name/description
- Per-collection mode columns (Light, Dark, Custom) matching Figma's Variables panel
- Color swatches, alias resolution, and click-to-copy on any value
- Works without Enterprise plan via Desktop Bridge (local mode)

### Design System Dashboard

A Lighthouse-style health scorecard that audits your design system across six categories.

**Usage:** Ask Claude to "audit the design system" or "show me design system health" while connected to a Figma file.

**Features:**
- Overall weighted score (0–100) with six category gauges: Naming, Tokens, Components, Accessibility, Consistency, Coverage
- Expandable category sections with individual findings, severity indicators, and actionable details
- Diagnostic locations linking findings to specific variables, components, or collections
- Tooltips explaining each check's purpose and scoring criteria
- Refresh button to re-run the audit without consuming AI context
- Pure scoring engine with no external dependencies — all analysis runs locally

**Enabling MCP Apps:**

MCP Apps are enabled by default in the setup configurations above (via `"ENABLE_MCP_APPS": "true"`). If you set up before v1.10.0 and don't have this in your config, add it to your `env` section:

```

> **Note:** MCP Apps require an MCP client with [ext-apps protocol](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/misc/model_context_protocol/ext-apps) support (e.g. Claude Desktop). This feature is experimental and the protocol may evolve.

### Future MCP Apps Roadmap

Planned MCP Apps:

- **Component Gallery** — Visual browser for searching and previewing components with variant exploration
- **Style Inspector** — Interactive panel for exploring color, text, and effect styles with live previews
- **Variable Diff Viewer** — Side-by-side comparison of token values across modes and branches

The architecture supports adding new apps with minimal boilerplate — each app is a self-contained module with its own server-side tool registration and client-side UI.

## 🤝 vs. Figma Official MCP

**Figma Console MCP (This Project)** - Debugging & data extraction
- ✅ Real-time console logs from Figma plugins
- ✅ Screenshot capture and visual debugging
- ✅ Error stack traces and runtime monitoring
- ✅ Raw design data extraction (JSON)
- ✅ Works remotely or locally

**Figma Official Dev Mode MCP** - Code generation
- ✅ Generates React/HTML code from designs
- ✅ Tailwind/CSS class generation
- ✅ Component boilerplate scaffolding

**Use both together** for the complete workflow: generate code with Official MCP, then debug and extract data with Console MCP.
