> **Your design system as an API.** Model Context Protocol server that bridges design and development—giving AI assistants complete access to Figma for **extraction**, **creation**, and **debugging**.

## What is this?

Figma Console MCP connects AI assistants (like Claude) to Figma, enabling:

- **🐛 Plugin debugging** - Capture console logs, errors, and stack traces
- **📸 Visual debugging** - Take screenshots for context
- **🎨 Design system extraction** - Pull variables, components, and styles
- **✏️ Design creation** - Create UI components, frames, and layouts directly in Figma
- **🔧 Variable management** - Create, update, rename, and delete design tokens
- **⚡ Real-time monitoring** - Watch logs as plugins execute
- **🔄 Three ways to install** - Remote SSE (OAuth, zero-setup), NPX (npm package), or Local Git (source code)

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Choose Your Setup

**First, decide what you want to do:**

| I want to... | Setup Method | Time |
|--------------|--------------|------|
| **Create and modify designs with AI** | [NPX Setup](#-npx-setup-recommended) (Recommended) | ~10 min |
| **Contribute to the project** | [Local Git Setup](#for-contributors-local-git-mode) | ~15 min |
| **Just explore my design data** (read-only) | [Remote SSE](#-remote-sse-read-only-exploration) | ~2 min |

### ⚠️ Important: Capability Differences

| Capability | NPX / Local Git | Remote SSE |
|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Read design data | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Create components & frames** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Edit existing designs** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Manage design tokens/variables** | ✅ | ❌ |
| Desktop Bridge plugin | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Total tools available** | **72+** | **16** |

> **Bottom line:** Remote SSE is **read-only**. If you want AI to actually design in Figma, use NPX Setup.

---

### 🚀 NPX Setup (Recommended)

**Best for:** Designers who want full AI-assisted design capabilities.

**What you get:** All 72+ tools including design creation, variable management, and component instantiation.

#### Prerequisites

- [ ] **Node.js 18+** — Check with `node --version` ([Download](https://nodejs.org))
- [ ] **Figma Desktop** installed (not just the web app)
- [ ] **Claude Desktop** or another MCP client

#### Step 1: Get Your Figma Token

1. Go to [figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens)
2. Click **"Get personal access token"**
3. Enter description: `Figma Console MCP`
4. **Copy the token** — you won't see it again! (starts with `figd_`)

#### Step 2: Configure Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "figma-console-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Start Figma with Debug Mode

**Quit Figma completely**, then restart with debug flag:

**macOS:**
```bash
open -a "Figma" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

**Windows:**
```
cmd /c "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Figma\Figma.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

Verify at [http://localhost:9222](http://localhost:9222) — you should see inspectable Figma pages.

#### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop

Quit and reopen Claude Desktop. Look for 🔌 icon showing "figma-console: connected".

#### Step 5: Test It!

```
Check Figma status
```
→ Should show "✅ Figma Desktop connected"

```
Create a simple frame with a blue background
```
→ Should create a frame in Figma (confirms write access!)

### For Contributors: Local Git Mode

**Best for:** Developers who want to modify source code or contribute to the project.

**What you get:** Same 72+ tools as NPX, plus full source code access.

#### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/southleft/figma-console-mcp.git
cd figma-console-mcp
npm install
npm run build:local
```

#### Configure Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/figma-console-mcp/dist/local.js"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then follow [NPX Steps 3-5](#step-3-start-figma-with-debug-mode) above.

**📖 [Complete Setup Guide](docs/setup.md)**

---

### 📡 Remote SSE (Read-Only Exploration)

**Best for:** Quickly evaluating the tool or read-only design data extraction.

**What you get:** 16 read-only tools — view data, take screenshots, read logs. **Cannot create or modify designs.**

#### Claude Desktop (UI Method)

1. Open Claude Desktop → **Settings** → **Connectors**
2. Click **"Add Custom Connector"**
3. Enter:
   - **Name:** `Figma Console (Read-Only)`
   - **URL:** `https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse`
4. Click **"Add"** — Done! ✅

OAuth authentication happens automatically when you first use design system tools.

#### Claude Code

> **⚠️ Known Issue:** Claude Code's native `--transport sse` has a [bug](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/2466). Use `mcp-remote` instead:

```bash
claude mcp add figma-console -s user -- npx -y mcp-remote@latest https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse
```

**💡 Tip:** For full capabilities, use [NPX Setup](#-npx-setup-recommended) instead of Remote SSE.

#### Other Clients (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎨 AI-Assisted Design Creation

> **⚠️ Local Mode Only:** This feature requires the Desktop Bridge plugin and only works with [Local Mode installation](#for-plugin-developers-local-mode). Remote Mode is read-only and cannot create or modify designs.

One of the most powerful capabilities of this MCP server is the ability to **design complete UI components and pages directly in Figma through natural language conversation** with any MCP-compatible AI assistant like Claude Desktop or Claude Code.

### What's Possible

**Create original designs from scratch:**
```
Design a login card with email and password fields, a "Forgot password?" link,
and a primary Sign In button. Use 32px padding, 16px border radius, and subtle shadow.
```

**Leverage existing component libraries:**
```
Build a dashboard header using the Avatar component for the user profile,
Button components for actions, and Badge components for notifications.
```

**Generate complete page layouts:**
```
Create a settings page with a sidebar navigation, a main content area with form fields,
and a sticky footer with Save and Cancel buttons.
```

### How It Works

1. **You describe what you want** in plain English
2. **The AI searches your component library** using `figma_search_components` to find relevant building blocks
3. **Components are instantiated** with proper variants and properties via `figma_instantiate_component`
4. **Custom elements are created** using the full Figma Plugin API via `figma_execute`
5. **Visual validation** automatically captures screenshots and iterates until the design looks right

### Who Benefits

| Role | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **Designers** | Rapidly prototype ideas without manual frame-by-frame construction. Explore variations quickly by describing changes. |
| **Developers** | Generate UI mockups during planning discussions. Create visual specs without switching to design tools. |
| **Product Managers** | Sketch out feature concepts during ideation. Communicate visual requirements directly to stakeholders. |
| **Design System Teams** | Test component flexibility by generating compositions. Identify gaps in component coverage. |
| **Agencies** | Speed up initial concept delivery. Iterate on client feedback in real-time during calls. |

### Example Workflows

**Brand New Design:**
> "Create a notification toast with an icon on the left, title and description text, and a dismiss button. Use our brand colors."

The AI creates custom frames, applies your design tokens, and builds the component from scratch.

**Component Composition:**
> "Build a user profile card using the Avatar component (large size), two Button components (Edit Profile and Settings), and a Badge for the user's status."

The AI searches your library, finds the exact components, and assembles them with proper spacing and alignment.

**Design Iteration:**
> "The spacing feels too tight. Increase the gap between sections to 24px and make the heading larger."

The AI modifies the existing design, takes a screenshot to verify, and continues iterating until you're satisfied.

### Visual Validation

The AI automatically follows a validation workflow after creating designs:

1. **Create** → Execute the design code
2. **Screenshot** → Capture the result
3. **Analyze** → Check alignment, spacing, and visual balance
4. **Iterate** → Fix any issues detected
5. **Verify** → Final screenshot to confirm

This ensures designs aren't just technically correct—they *look* right.

## 🧩 MCP Apps (Experimental)

Figma Console MCP includes support for **MCP Apps** — rich interactive UI experiences that render directly inside any MCP client that supports the [MCP Apps protocol extension](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/misc/model_context_protocol/ext-apps). Built with the official [`@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps) SDK.

> **What are MCP Apps?** Traditional MCP tools return text or images to the AI. MCP Apps go further — they render interactive HTML interfaces inline in the chat, allowing users to browse, filter, and interact with data directly without consuming AI context.

### Token Browser

An interactive design token explorer.

**Usage:** Ask Claude to "browse the design tokens" or "show me the design tokens" while connected to a Figma file.

**Features:**
- Browse all tokens organized by collection with expandable sections
- Filter by type (Colors, Numbers, Strings) and search by name/description
- Per-collection mode columns (Light, Dark, Custom) matching Figma's Variables panel
- Color swatches, alias resolution, and click-to-copy on any value
- Works without Enterprise plan via Desktop Bridge (local mode)

### Design System Dashboard

A Lighthouse-style health scorecard that audits your design system across six categories.

**Usage:** Ask Claude to "audit the design system" or "show me design system health" while connected to a Figma file.

**Features:**
- Overall weighted score (0–100) with six category gauges: Naming, Tokens, Components, Accessibility, Consistency, Coverage
- Expandable category sections with individual findings, severity indicators, and actionable details
- Diagnostic locations linking findings to specific variables, components, or collections
- Tooltips explaining each check's purpose and scoring criteria
- Refresh button to re-run the audit without consuming AI context
- Pure scoring engine with no external dependencies — all analysis runs locally

**Enabling MCP Apps:**

MCP Apps are gated behind an environment variable. Add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console-local": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/figma-console-mcp/dist/local.js"],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "figd_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
        "ENABLE_MCP_APPS": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** MCP Apps require an MCP client with [ext-apps protocol](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/misc/model_context_protocol/ext-apps) support (e.g. Claude Desktop). This feature is experimental and the protocol may evolve.

### Future MCP Apps Roadmap

Planned MCP Apps:

- **Component Gallery** — Visual browser for searching and previewing components with variant exploration
- **Style Inspector** — Interactive panel for exploring color, text, and effect styles with live previews
- **Variable Diff Viewer** — Side-by-side comparison of token values across modes and branches

The architecture supports adding new apps with minimal boilerplate — each app is a self-contained module with its own server-side tool registration and client-side UI.
