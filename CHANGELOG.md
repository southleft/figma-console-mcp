# Changelog

All notable changes to Figma Console MCP will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.9.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **`FIGMA_WS_HOST` environment variable** — Override the WebSocket server bind address (default: `localhost`). Set to `0.0.0.0` when running inside Docker so the host machine can reach the MCP server. (Thanks [@mikeziri](https://github.com/mikeziri) — [#10](https://github.com/southleft/figma-console-mcp/pull/10))

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Figma Comments tools** — 3 new MCP tools for managing comments on Figma files via REST API
  - `figma_get_comments` — Retrieve comment threads with author, message, timestamps, and pinned node locations. Supports `as_md` for markdown output and `include_resolved` to filter resolved threads.
  - `figma_post_comment` — Post comments pinned to specific design nodes. Use after `figma_check_design_parity` to notify designers of drift when code is the canonical source. Supports threaded replies.
  - `figma_delete_comment` — Delete comments by ID for cleanup after issues are resolved.
  - Works in both Local (NPX) and Remote (Cloudflare Workers) modes — pure REST API, no Plugin API dependency.
  - OAuth tokens require `file_comments:write` scope for posting and deleting. Personal access tokens work as-is.

### Fixed
- **Misleading "No connection" error when WebSocket port is in use** — When another MCP server instance already occupied port 9223, `figma_get_status` reported "No connection to Figma Desktop" and advised opening the Desktop Bridge plugin. Now correctly detects `EADDRINUSE` and reports: "WebSocket port 9223 is already in use by another process" with instructions to close the other shell.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **WebSocket Bridge transport** — Automatic fallback transport layer for when Figma removes Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) support
  - New `IFigmaConnector` interface abstracts transport layer (`src/core/figma-connector.ts`)
  - `FigmaDesktopConnector` (CDP) and `WebSocketConnector` implementations
  - WebSocket server on port 9223 (configurable via `FIGMA_WS_PORT` env var)
  - Auto-detection: WebSocket preferred when available, CDP fallback when not
  - Zero user action needed if CDP still works — fully backward compatible
  - Desktop Bridge plugin UI includes WebSocket client with auto-reconnect
  - Request/response correlation for reliable command execution over WebSocket
- **`figma_reconnect` tool** — Force reconnection to Figma Desktop, useful for switching transports or recovering from connection issues
- **Transport info in `figma_get_status`** — Status now reports which transport is active (CDP or WebSocket)
- **File identity tracking** — Plugin proactively reports file name and key on WebSocket connect via `FILE_INFO` message. The MCP server tracks connected file identity instantly (no roundtrip needed), and `figma_get_status` now includes `currentFileKey` and `connectedFile` details. AI instructions warn to verify file identity before destructive operations when multiple files are open.
- **Document change event forwarding** — Plugin listens to `figma.on('documentchange')` and forwards change events (node changes, style changes) through WebSocket. The MCP server uses these events to automatically invalidate the variable cache when design changes occur, preventing stale data.
- **WebSocket console monitoring** — Console tools (`figma_get_console_logs`, `figma_watch_console`, `figma_clear_console`) now work without CDP. The plugin overrides `console.log/warn/error/info/debug` in the QuickJS sandbox and forwards captured messages through WebSocket to the MCP server. Captures all plugin-context logs; for full-page monitoring (Figma app internals), CDP is still available.
- **WebSocket plugin UI reload** — `figma_reload_plugin` now works via WebSocket by re-invoking `figma.showUI()` to reload the plugin UI iframe. The `code.js` context continues running; only the UI is refreshed and the WebSocket connection auto-reconnects.
- **Graceful `figma_navigate` in WebSocket mode** — Instead of failing silently, `figma_navigate` now detects WebSocket-only mode and returns actionable guidance: the connected file identity and instructions to manually navigate in Figma Desktop.
- **`figma_get_selection` tool** — Real-time selection tracking via WebSocket. The AI knows what the user has selected in Figma without needing to ask. Returns node IDs, names, types, and dimensions. Optional `verbose` mode fetches fills, strokes, text content, and component properties for selected nodes. Selection state updates automatically as the user clicks around.
- **`figma_get_design_changes` tool** — Buffered document change event feed. The AI can ask "what changed since I last checked?" instead of re-reading the entire file. Returns change events with node IDs, style/node change flags, and timestamps. Supports `since` timestamp filtering and `clear` for polling workflows. Buffer holds up to 200 events.
- **Live page tracking** — `figma_get_status` now reports which page the user is currently viewing, updated in real-time via `figma.on('currentpagechange')`. Combined with selection tracking, the AI knows both "where" (page) and "what" (selection) without roundtrips.

### Fixed
- **`figma_get_component_image` crash** — Was using `api.getFile()` with `ids` param but accessing `fileData.nodes[nodeId]` which doesn't exist on the file endpoint response. Changed to `api.getNodes()` which returns the correct `{ nodes: { nodeId: { document } } }` structure.
- **`figma_set_instance_properties` crash with dynamic-page access** — Plugin code used synchronous `node.componentProperties` and `node.mainComponent` which fail with `documentAccess: "dynamic-page"`. Added `await node.getMainComponentAsync()` before accessing properties.
- **Rename tools showing "from undefined"** — The `handleResult` function in `ui.html` was only passing through the `dataKey` field, dropping `oldName` from rename operation responses. Fixed to pass through `oldName` and `instance` fields.
- **`figma_capture_screenshot` and `figma_set_instance_properties` bypassing WebSocket** — Both tools had a try/catch wrapper around `getDesktopConnector()` that silently swallowed errors and fell through to a legacy CDP fallback path, even when the connector factory was available. Removed the try/catch so errors propagate directly, and added a `!getDesktopConnector` guard so the legacy path only runs when no connector factory exists.
- **Transport priority reversed for reliability** — `getDesktopConnector()` now tries WebSocket first (instant connectivity check) then falls back to CDP (which involves a network timeout). Previously CDP was tried first, and its timeout delay caused race conditions during file switching.
- **Multi-file WebSocket client cycling** — When multiple Figma files had the Desktop Bridge plugin open, background plugins would aggressively reconnect (500ms backoff) after being displaced, creating an infinite replacement loop. Fixed by detecting the "Replaced by new connection" close reason in the plugin UI and stopping auto-reconnect for displaced instances, while keeping the standard reconnection backoff (up to 5 seconds) for other disconnections.
- **MCP Apps (Token Browser + Dashboard) bypassing WebSocket** — Both apps used `browserManager` (CDP-only) to construct a `FigmaDesktopConnector` directly, skipping WebSocket entirely. In WebSocket-only mode, they fell through to REST API (Enterprise plan required). Changed to use the transport-agnostic `getDesktopConnector()` which works with both WebSocket and CDP.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Design-code parity checker** (`figma_check_design_parity`) — Compares a Figma component's design tokens against a code implementation to identify visual discrepancies in colors, typography, spacing, borders, and shadows
- **Component documentation generator** (`figma_generate_component_doc`) — Generates comprehensive developer documentation for Figma components including props/variants tables, design token mappings, usage examples, and accessibility guidelines

## [1.6.4] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- **Variables timeout for large design systems** — Increased `REFRESH_VARIABLES` timeout from 15 seconds to 5 minutes, matching the `GET_LOCAL_COMPONENTS` timeout. Fixes MCP disconnects when loading design systems with many variables.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-02-04

### Performance
- **Batched page processing for large design systems** — Component search now processes pages in batches of 3 with event loop yields between batches. This prevents UI freeze and potential crashes when loading design systems with many pages and components. Progress logging added for debugging large file loads.

### Fixed
- **Component instantiation error messages** — Removed misleading "unpublished or deleted from library" wording that caused AI assistants to incorrectly suggest publishing component libraries. New messages clarify that `componentKey` only works for published library components, and that local components require `nodeId`. Guides users to pass both identifiers together for reliable instantiation.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- **Component instantiation error messages** — Same fix as above (released to address immediate user feedback).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **File name subheader** in Token Browser UI — Displays the Figma file name below "Design Tokens" title, matching the Design System Health dashboard style

### Fixed
- **MCP App UI caching** — Fixed issue where Claude Desktop would show stale data when reusing cached app iframes. Both Token Browser and Dashboard now refresh data via `ontoolresult` when a new tool request is made
- **Tab switching with Desktop Bridge** — Fixed plugin frame cache not being cleared when `figma_navigate` switches between Figma tabs, causing the bridge to communicate with the wrong file
- **Dashboard URL tracking** — Fixed `figma_audit_design_system` not tracking the actual file URL when called without an explicit URL parameter, causing the dashboard UI to fetch data for the wrong file

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **Batch variable tools** for high-performance bulk operations
  - `figma_batch_create_variables` — Create up to 100 variables in one call (10-50x faster than individual calls)
  - `figma_batch_update_variables` — Update up to 100 variable values in one call
  - `figma_setup_design_tokens` — Create a complete token system (collection + modes + variables) atomically
- **Plugin frame caching** — Cached Desktop Bridge plugin frame reference eliminates redundant DOM lookups
- **Diagnostic gating** — Console log capture gated behind active monitoring to reduce idle overhead
- **Batch routing guidance** in MCP server instructions so AI models prefer batch tools automatically

### Changed
- Tool descriptions trimmed for token efficiency (`figma_execute` -75%, `figma_arrange_component_set` -78%)
- JSON responses compacted across 113 `JSON.stringify` calls (removed `null, 2` formatting)
- Individual variable tool descriptions now cross-reference batch alternatives

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Design System Health Dashboard** — Lighthouse-style MCP App that audits design system quality across six weighted categories
  - Scoring categories: Naming & Semantics (25%), Token Architecture (20%), Component Metadata (20%), Consistency (15%), Accessibility (10%), Coverage (10%)
  - Overall weighted score (0–100) with per-category gauge rings and severity indicators
  - Expandable category sections with individual findings, actionable details, and diagnostic locations
  - Tooltips explaining each check's purpose and scoring criteria
  - Refresh button for re-auditing without consuming AI context
  - Pure scoring engine with no external dependencies — all analysis runs locally
  - `figma_audit_design_system` tool with context-efficient summary (full data stays in UI)
  - `ds_dashboard_refresh` app-only tool for UI-initiated re-audit

### Fixed
- **Smart tab navigation** — `figma_navigate` now detects when a file is already open in a browser tab and switches to it instead of overwriting a different tab. Console monitoring automatically transfers to the switched tab.

### Documentation
- Design System Dashboard added to README and MCP Apps documentation
- Updated MCP Apps roadmap (dashboard moved from planned to shipped)
- Updated docs site banner for v1.5

## [1.4.0] - 2025-01-27

### Added
- **MCP Apps Framework** — Extensible architecture for rich interactive UI experiences powered by the [MCP Apps protocol](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/tree/main/misc/model_context_protocol/ext-apps)
  - Modular multi-app build system using Vite with single-file HTML output
  - Parameterized `vite.config.ts` supporting unlimited apps via `APP_NAME` env var
  - Gated behind `ENABLE_MCP_APPS=true` — zero impact on existing tools
- **Token Browser MCP App** — Interactive design token explorer rendered inline in Claude Desktop
  - Browse all design tokens organized by collection with expandable sections
  - Filter by type (Colors, Numbers, Strings) and search by name or description
  - Per-collection mode columns (Light/Dark/Custom) matching Figma's Variables panel layout
  - Color swatches with hex/rgba values, alias reference resolution, and click-to-copy
  - Desktop Bridge priority — works without Enterprise plan via local plugin
  - Compact table layout with sticky headers and horizontal scroll for many modes
  - `figma_browse_tokens` tool with context-efficient summary (full data stays in UI)
  - `token_browser_refresh` app-only tool for UI-initiated data refresh
