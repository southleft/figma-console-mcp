# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Plugin console logs not captured (RESOLVED ✅)

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Native worker monitoring now enabled!

**What Changed:**
The Figma Console MCP now **automatically monitors Web Workers** where Figma plugins run. No plugin code changes required!

**How It Works:**
- Monitors main page console (Figma web app)
- **NEW:** Monitors all Web Worker consoles (Figma plugins)
- Automatically detects when workers are created/destroyed
- Merges all console logs into a single stream
- Tags logs with source: `'plugin'`, `'figma'`, `'page'`

**What You'll See:**
```json
{
  "logs": [
    {
      "timestamp": 1705318245123,
      "level": "log",
      "message": "[PropertyFilter] Starting analysis...",
      "source": "plugin",
      "workerUrl": "https://www.figma.com/plugin-worker/abc123"
    },
    {
      "timestamp": 1705318246456,
      "level": "error",
      "message": "[ClaudeClient] Token mapping failed",
      "source": "plugin",
      "workerUrl": "https://www.figma.com/plugin-worker/abc123"
    }
  ]
}
```

**No Action Required:**
Your plugin's `console.log()` statements will be captured automatically. Just use the MCP as normal:

```javascript
figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/...' })
figma_get_console_logs({ count: 100 })
```

**If You Still Don't See Plugin Logs:**

1. **Check timing:** Make sure you run the plugin AFTER navigating
   ```javascript
   figma_navigate({ url: '...' })
   // Now run your plugin in Figma
   figma_get_console_logs() // Should capture plugin logs
   ```

2. **Check worker count:** Use `figma_get_status()` to verify workers are detected
   ```json
   {
     "consoleMonitor": {
       "isMonitoring": true,
       "workerCount": 2  // Should be > 0 when plugin is running
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Check log levels:** Use `level: 'all'` to ensure nothing is filtered
   ```javascript
   figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'all', count: 500 })
   ```

**Technical Details:**
The MCP uses Puppeteer's Worker APIs to:
- Enumerate existing workers via `page.workers()`
- Listen for new workers via `page.on('workercreated')`
- Attach console listeners to each worker
- Tag worker logs with `source: 'plugin'`

This is the same mechanism Figma's own DevTools uses, just exposed natively through the MCP.

### Issue: "Browser isn't currently running"

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: "The browser isn't currently running"
- `figma_get_status` shows `browser.running: false`

**Cause:**
You haven't called `figma_navigate` yet to initialize the browser.

**Solution:**

Always start with `figma_navigate`:

```javascript
figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/your-file-id' })
```

This tool:
- Launches the headless Chrome browser
- Initializes console monitoring
- Navigates to your Figma file

Then check status:

```javascript
figma_get_status()
```

Should show:
- `browser.running: true`
- `initialized: true`
- `consoleMonitor.isMonitoring: true`

**Note:** If using the public server at `https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com`, browser launch is handled automatically and should work without issues.

---

### Issue: "Failed to retrieve console logs"

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Console monitor not initialized"
- Error: "Make sure to call figma_navigate first"

**Solution:**
Always use this workflow:
```
1. figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/...' })
2. Wait for success response
3. Then use figma_get_console_logs()
```

---

### Issue: Screenshot Returns Empty Data

**Symptoms:**
- Screenshot tool succeeds but image is blank
- Base64 data is present but doesn't render

**Possible Causes:**
1. Page hasn't fully loaded yet
2. Plugin UI isn't visible
3. Timing issue

**Solution:**
```
1. figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/...' })
2. Wait 2-3 seconds (automatic in figma_navigate)
3. figma_take_screenshot({ target: 'full-page' })
```

Try different targets:
- `'full-page'` - Entire page including scrollable areas
- `'viewport'` - Currently visible area
- `'plugin'` - Plugin UI only (may need to be visible first)

---

### Issue: No Console Logs Captured

**Symptoms:**
- `figma_get_console_logs()` returns empty array
- Log count is 0

**Possible Causes:**
1. Plugin hasn't executed yet
2. Plugin doesn't produce console output
3. Logs are being filtered out

**Solutions:**

#### Check Plugin Execution
```
1. figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/...' })
2. Interact with the plugin in Figma
3. figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'all' })
```

#### Check Log Levels
Try different level filters:
```
figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'all' })     // Everything
figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'error' })   // Only errors
figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'log' })     // Only console.log
figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'warn' })    // Only warnings
```

#### Check Timing
```
1. figma_navigate({ url: '...' })
2. figma_get_status()  // Check log count
3. If logCount > 0, logs are being captured
```

### Issue: "Connection timed out" or Network Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Claude Desktop shows connection timeout
- Tools take very long to respond
- Intermittent failures

**Possible Causes:**
1. Cloudflare Workers cold start
2. Browser initialization takes time
3. Figma page load is slow

**Solutions:**

#### Allow More Time
The first call to `figma_navigate` can take 10-30 seconds:
- Browser needs to launch
- Figma needs to load
- Console monitoring needs to initialize

Just wait - subsequent calls will be faster!

#### Use figma_get_status
This is a lightweight call that doesn't require browser initialization:
```
figma_get_status()  // Fast, shows current state
```

#### Check Server Health
```bash
curl https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Figma Console MCP",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "endpoints": ["/sse", "/mcp", "/test-browser"]
}
```

### Issue: Claude Desktop Not Seeing Tools

**Symptoms:**
- MCP server connected but no tools visible
- Tools list is empty

**Solutions:**

#### Check Configuration

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "figma-console": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** URL must be exactly `https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com/sse` (note the `/sse` endpoint).

#### Restart Claude Desktop
After changing configuration:
1. Quit Claude Desktop completely
2. Restart it
3. Check the tools menu

#### Verify mcp-remote
Make sure `mcp-remote` is installed:
```bash
npm list -g mcp-remote
```

If not installed:
```bash
npm install -g mcp-remote
```

## Workflow Best Practices

### Recommended Workflow

```
# 1. Start session
figma_navigate({ url: 'https://www.figma.com/design/your-file' })

# 2. Check initial state
figma_get_status()

# 3. Work with plugin, then check logs
figma_get_console_logs({ level: 'error' })

# 4. Capture UI state
figma_take_screenshot({ target: 'plugin' })

# 5. Make code changes, reload
figma_reload_plugin({ clearConsole: true })

# 6. Clear for next test
figma_clear_console()
```

### Tips

**1. Always Navigate First**
- `figma_navigate` must be the first call
- It initializes everything
- Subsequent calls will fail without it

**2. Use figma_get_status for Health Checks**
- Lightweight and fast
- Shows browser state
- Shows log count without retrieving logs

**3. Clear Console Between Tests**
- Prevents old logs from mixing with new ones
- `figma_clear_console()` or `figma_reload_plugin({ clearConsole: true })`

**4. Be Patient on First Call**
- Browser launch takes time
- First navigation is slowest
- Subsequent operations are faster

**5. Check Error Messages**
- Error messages include helpful hints
- Often suggest the next step to try
- Include troubleshooting tips

## Technical Details

### Browser Session Lifecycle

1. **First Call to figma_navigate:**
   - Launches Puppeteer browser (10-15s)
   - Initializes console monitoring
   - Navigates to Figma URL
   - Starts capturing logs

2. **Subsequent Calls:**
   - Reuse existing browser instance
   - Much faster (1-2s)
   - Logs accumulated in circular buffer

3. **Session Timeout:**
   - Browser kept alive for 10 minutes
   - After timeout, automatically relaunches on next call

### Console Log Buffer

- **Size:** 1000 logs (configurable)
- **Type:** Circular buffer (oldest logs dropped when full)
- **Capture:** Real-time via Chrome DevTools Protocol
- **Source Detection:** Automatically identifies plugin vs Figma logs

### Screenshot Format

- **Formats:** PNG (lossless), JPEG (with quality control)
- **Encoding:** Base64 for easy transmission
- **Targets:**
  - `full-page`: Entire page with scrollable content
  - `viewport`: Currently visible area only
  - `plugin`: Plugin iframe only (experimental)

## Environment Variables

For local development or custom deployments:

```bash
# Log level (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
LOG_LEVEL=info

# Configuration file location
FIGMA_CONSOLE_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json

# Node environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

## Advanced Configuration

Create `~/.config/figma-console-mcp/config.json`:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "headless": true,
    "args": ["--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled"]
  },
  "console": {
    "bufferSize": 2000,
    "filterLevels": ["log", "info", "warn", "error", "debug"],
    "truncation": {
      "maxStringLength": 1000,
      "maxArrayLength": 20,
      "maxObjectDepth": 5
    }
  },
  "screenshots": {
    "defaultFormat": "png",
    "quality": 95
  }
}
```

**Note:** Custom configuration is optional. The public server at `https://figma-console-mcp.southleft.com` uses sensible defaults that work for most use cases.
